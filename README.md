Random Ideas
============

Inspired by [Juan Benet own random-ideas repo](https://github.com/jbenet/random-ideas) and [David Dias own random-ideas](https://github.com/diasdavid/random-ideas), I decided to make one for myself to create some kind of permanent record of the ideas + discussions sometimes I get to have :)

I welcome everyone to give feedback :D <3
